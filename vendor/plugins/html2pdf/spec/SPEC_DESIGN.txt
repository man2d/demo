## Spec design ##

The specs are created using RSpec 2.0 and Mocha as the mocking framework.

Currently (as of may 27th) the specs only contains spec skeletons to test the various HTML tag (element) renderers.
The specs are currently without 'should' verifications. Prawn contains methods to assist with verifying the actual output of prawn and these should be used.
